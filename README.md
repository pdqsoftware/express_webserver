This web-based project was created in order to give me a simple weather App for daily use.
It also contains its own API front end giving out a basic summary of weather at the requested location (which I use on my phone).
The next stage will be to create a bigger and better version of this project that provides the opportunity of selecting either an hourly weather for the current day/24 hours, or a seven day forecast.
